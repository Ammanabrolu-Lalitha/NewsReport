      <h2 class="introduction">Haryana Floor Test Live Updates: Congress
expresses ‘no confidence’ easily; they won’t come to power,
says CM Manohar Lal Khattar</h2>
         <h2>Haryana Floor Test Live News Updates:</h2>
      <p> The BJP-JJP government has defeated Congress’ no-confidence motion in the Haryana Assembly. All Congress MLAs supported the no-confidence motion while BJP-JJP MLAs voted against it. The no-confidence motion was supported by 32 members and opposed by 55 members.

JJP MLAs Ram Kumar Gautam and Devender Babli, who had been speaking against the government asking JJP to withdraw support from BJP, also voted against the no-confidence motion. Gopal Kanda, too, supported the alliance and voted against the motion.

The Assembly currently has a strength of 88 members, meaning the ruling alliance needed 45 votes to stay in power.

Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said the “no-confidence motion will let people know which MLA stands with the government and which MLA stands with farmers.”</p>
<h3>Farmers' issues are a sensitive matter, don't play politics: Harvinder Kalyan to Congress MLAs</h3>
        <p>Harvinder Kalyan, BJP MLA from Gharaunda, rises to speak. "Why are these farm legislations called black, just because these came out from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pen? If one constructs a house and some discrepancies in electricity and water pipelines are later detected, do you correct those discrepancies or raze the entire house?

"Farmers' issues are an extremely sensitive matter. The Congress should not play politics on such a sensitive subject. Being a farmer myself, I emphasize that these three farm legislations must be implemented and taken forward to ensure their welfare.

"An environment is being created to ensure no MLA from the ruling party can enter any village, but Opposition must not consider it their achievement. Society will never forgive the Opposition for creating such an environment. I vote against this no confidence motion and ask everybody else also to vote against it," he says.</p>

        <h3>Congress about to sink deeper, its future will end soon: CM</h3>
        <p>Even as Congress MLA Raghuvir Kadiyan tries to interrupt him, CM Khattar said, “The Congress party will continue to sink deeper. Your political future is about to end. Who all have instigated farmers? Who all are instigating protestors? The people are watching it. So far it has caused a loss of Rs 212."

He adds, "Since November 26, industries associations have apprised us that they have incurred losses worth Rs 11,000 crore. Nobody from the opposition have so far said that this ongoing protest is wrong. Tomorrow, if situation deteriorates, it will disturb the state's peace, it will disturb the communal harmony.”</p>


        <h3>Farm laws will not be repealed, says CM</h3>
        <p>As Hooda asks him to resume talks, the CM says, “Kisan morcha has yesterday told media that they have constituted a nine-member committee. I am sure that it will help resume talks. I agree talks should be taken forward. But I am saying that it is causing losses.”

He adds, “Talks will resume, suggestions are coming in. But the farm laws will not be repealed. I will not ask for the laws to be repealed. When I am not convinced, why will I say it? There can be amendments. But I am repeatedly saying that repealing the laws is not going to serve any purpose. If these had to be repealed, it would have happened two months ago. Whatever amendments will happen, it will be it the government or in the Supreme Court.”</p>

<h3>All Cong MLAs vote for no-confidence motion, all BJP and JJP legislators vote against it</h3>
   <p>Speaker asks members who support no-confidence motion to rise. All Congress MLAs support no-confidence motion. All BJP-JJP MLAs vote against it.

JJP MLAs Ram Kumar Gautam and Devender Babli, who had been speaking against the government asking JJP to withdraw support from BJP also vote against the no-confidence motion. Gopal Kanda, too, supports the alliance, votes against the motion.
   </p>
        <h3>Result announced by Speaker. No-confidence motion supported by 32 members and opposed by 55 members. The No-confidence motion is defeated</h3>
